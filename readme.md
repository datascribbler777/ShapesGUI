# GUI Exercise
This is just a simple program to test out building a GUI in C++. Shoot me now.

## Notes
Made using raylib. I would link to it, but the guy that makes it is rude bastard. I mention using the library for the license.

The makefile does not work yet. I have to figure out how to get raylib linking properly in it. Or chew up some razorblades, whichever I think will be less painful.
The batfile included may work for you. 
Yes, I have included my bin folder and the binaries I built. I know what you are thinking, how could I do that not knowing what system the user will have.
If only there were an operating system that the vast majority of the world used. If I made it I think I would call it "HoleInWallWithGlass". Go die in a fire. ðŸ”¥
