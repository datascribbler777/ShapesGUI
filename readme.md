# GUI Exercise
This is just a simple program to test out building a GUI in C++. Shoot me now.

## Notes
Made using raylib. I would link to it, but the guy that makes it is rude bastard. I mention using the library for the license.

The makefile does not work yet. I have to figure out how to get raylib linking properly in it. Or chew up some razorblades, whichever I think will be less painful.
The batfile included may work for you. 

## Features So Far
* Windows
* Labels
* Text Box
